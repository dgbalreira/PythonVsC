C Students,"O1 - Suppose you are hired to develop a program that stores and manages student information at a university. Choose the best alternative that represents an important question to ask at the beginning of the project.
A. How many buildings does the university have?
(B). What information is filled in by students at the time of enrollment?
C. What is the name of the university's founder?
D. How many students use school transport to get to the university?
E. How long has the university existed?","O2 - Suppose you are hired to develop a program that stores and manages student information at a university. Choose the best way to store data from two distinct categories: new and old students.
A.
- Use a single vector / list, where the odd indices contain information from the old and the even the new students;
- Veterans and freshmen must be represented by the same struct / class.
B.
- Use a single vector / list, where the odd indices contain information from the old and the even the new students;
- Veterans and freshmen must be represented by different structs / classes.
C.
- Use two vectors / lists, one of which refers to old and the other to new students;
- Veterans and freshmen must be represented by different structs / classes.
D.
- Use two vectors / lists, one of which refers to old and the other to new students;
- Veterans and freshmen must be represented by strings.
E.
- Use a single vector / list, where the odd indices contain information from the old and the even the new students;
- Veterans and freshmen must be represented by strings.","O3 - Suppose you are hired to develop a program that stores and manages student information at a university. Choose the best alternative to count how many registered students are underage.
A. The program has sequential and iterative commands only - conditionals are not necessary. In iterative commands, particular preference should be given to the while statement over the for statement.
B. The program has conditional commands only - iteratives are not necessary.
C. The program has iterative commands only - conditionals are not necessary. In iterative commands, particular preference should be given to the for statement over the while statement.
D. The program has sequential, conditional and iterative commands. In iterative commands, particular preference should be given to the while statement over the for statement.
E. The program has sequential, conditional and iterative commands. In iterative commands, particular preference should be given to the for statement over the while statement.","O4 - Suppose you are hired to develop a program that stores and manages student information at a university. Choose the best way to implement adding and searching operations to retrieve students' data in a vector/list.
A.
- Add student: places a student in an occupied space of the vector / list;
- Search for student: search for a student at his / her age.
B.
- Add student: places a student in an occupied space of the vector / list;
- Search for student: search for a student by his / her date of birth.
C.
- Add student: place a student in a free space in the vector / list;
- Search for student: search for a student by his / her enrollment number.
D.
- Add student: places a student in an occupied space of the vector / list;
- Search for student: search for a student by email.
E.
- Add student: place a student in a free space in the vector / list;
- Search for student: search for a student for his course.","O5 - Suppose you are hired to develop a program that stores and manages student information at a university. Choose the best alternative to permanently store the students' data.
A. Save the information of registered students in structs / classes, as long as each struct / class is responsible for a characteristic of the student.
B. Save the information of registered students in text files, where the information of different students is mixed between commas, on the same line.
C. Save the information of registered students in structs / classes, where the main information is separated by fields / attributes.
D. Save the information of registered students in text files, where each student is on a line with their information separated by commas.
E. Save the information of registered students in strings, where this information must be separated by blank spaces.",Total
